# Horiseon Code Refactor
## In this project, I consolidated the repetitive code in the CSS under the names *benefits* and *products* and made sure all the links connected because the Search Engine Optimization didn't have a Div Id.
## I also added overflow auto for the product CSS because they looked weird on my computer.

### I want to practice Markdown so I will make a table.

Actual issues|Issues Created in my Head
-------------|-------------------
The code was repetitive |The header didn't fit
Not all the links worked|The header wasn't completely covering the top of the page.
The text was weird on the product area|The text was didn't flow with a smaller webpage

## Here is a screenshot of the part I changed
